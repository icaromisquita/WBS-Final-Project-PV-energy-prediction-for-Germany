# My final project for the WBS Bootcamp

The objective was to obtain data from PVLib and PVGis and use it to create a machine learning (ML) model to predict the energy generate from PV systems for Germany.
Later using Streamlit an app was created were the user can provide inputs in a daily base or by using a csv file predict for more days. Finally the app can create a unique ML  with the user inputs and make predictions with it.

Libraries used
PVLib, Pandas, MatplotLib, SciKit-learn and Numpy.
